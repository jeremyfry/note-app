## Project Info
1. Run `npm install` - If you forget to do this, you'll see this: `babel-node: command not found`.
2. Run `npm run start` in the root of the project to start a local web server.
3. You can login user the username manager. Password doesn't matter.
4. Allow location to get the correct images for notes.
5. Don't skip the login page and go directly to /notes. That's hacking my super secure login system and that's not cool. 
6. I didn't get around to deleting notes or user permissions.
